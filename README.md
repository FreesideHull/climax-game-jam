# Getting Started

You'll need a working git client and godot install

Clone the repo and import the project

see [here](https://github.com/FreesideHull/climax-game-jam/blob/matt/howtogodot.odt) for how to develop if not using git, clone instead of downloading the zip if you are using git

# platform support

The game is available currently on both windows and linux, with macos support coming soon.  
Binaries are available to download [here](https://github.com/FreesideHull/climax-game-jam/releases/)  
Windows should work with no issues, just download the zip from the releases section, extract it and run the .exe file.  
Linux just needs an additional step after extracting the linux.zip file. you need to run `chmod +x Game.x86_64` in a terminal to make it executable. Then you should be able to run it
