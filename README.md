# Getting Started

You'll need a working git client and godot install

Clone the repo and import the project

Once cloned onto your local machine open the project by importing into godot (version 3.2.x)

Click on project / setup version control / then initialize to pull in the git repo

Further instructions will be dropped into doc as and when i get chance to write them :)

Recent changes allow the game to be ran on Linux with *no* (for now) issues. When updating assets we may come into some issues, these will be fixed without the need for symlinks.
